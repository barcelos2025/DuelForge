-- This logic is handled by the `ensure_player_bootstrap` RPC function
-- which assigns the default deck to new users.
-- However, if we wanted to define a "template" deck, we could store it here.

-- For now, this file serves as documentation that the default deck logic 
-- resides in the RPC function to ensure it's created per-user.
